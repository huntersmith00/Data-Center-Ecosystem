## 8.1 üèóÔ∏è Site Selection & Initial Planning

### Factors in Location Choice
- Proximity to power grids and fiber networks
- Climate and natural disaster risk (flood, earthquake)
- Regulatory environment and incentives
- Accessibility for staff and equipment logistics
- Environmental impact and community relations

---

## 8.2 üß± Structural Engineering & Architecture

- Design for heavy equipment loads and vibration control
- Seismic bracing and storm resistance
- Raised floors vs slab-on-grade considerations
- Building envelope for thermal insulation and security
- Space planning for future expansion and modular growth

---

## 8.3 ‚ö° Mechanical, Electrical & Plumbing (MEP) Engineering

### Mechanical Systems
- HVAC design: CRAC units, chillers, cooling towers
- Hot/cold aisle containment and airflow modeling
- Fire suppression systems: gaseous, sprinkler, and detection

### Electrical Systems
- Power distribution: transformers, switchgear, UPS, generators
- Redundancy and fault tolerance designs (N, N+1, 2N)
- Grounding and surge protection
- Lighting and emergency power

### Plumbing
- Chilled water piping and pumps
- Leak detection and drainage
- Water quality management for cooling

---

## 8.4 üõ†Ô∏è Project Management & Construction

- Phased construction with minimal downtime (if retrofit)
- Coordination of multiple contractors and suppliers
- Quality assurance and commissioning
- Safety protocols and compliance with standards (OSHA, local codes)
- Documentation and as-built records

---

## 8.5 üå± Sustainability & Green Building Practices

- LEED and BREEAM certification goals
- Renewable energy integration (solar, wind)
- Water conservation and reuse
- Efficient lighting and materials selection
- Thermal energy storage and free cooling

---

## 8.6 üìê Modular & Prefabricated Data Centers

- Containerized and pod-based designs for rapid deployment
- Factory-built modules with standardized components
