Data centers generate significant volumes of electronic waste as equipment is retired or replaced. Responsible lifecycle management is essential to minimize environmental impact, comply with regulations, and recover value.

This guide explores the key practices, standards, and business opportunities in e-waste handling and hardware recycling.

## 9.1 ‚ôªÔ∏è The Data Center Hardware Lifecycle

### Stages
1. **Procurement & Deployment:** Asset tagging and tracking.
2. **Maintenance & Upgrades:** Firmware updates, component replacements.
3. **Decommissioning:** Secure data wiping, physical removal.
4. **Refurbishment & Resale:** Testing and resale of reusable parts.
5. **Recycling & Disposal:** Environmentally responsible processing.

## 9.2 üîê Secure Data Destruction

- Methods: Data wiping, degaussing, physical destruction.
- Compliance with standards such as NIST SP 800-88.
- Chain of custody documentation.
- Third-party certified destruction services.

---

## 9.3 üåç Environmental & Regulatory Compliance

- **WEEE Directive (EU):** Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment regulations.
- **R2 Standard:** Responsible recycling certification.
- **e-Stewards:** High ethical and environmental standards for recyclers.
- Local regulations on hazardous materials (lead, mercury, cadmium).
- Reporting and documentation requirements.
